# App that checks camera feed for differences in frames and captures them - kinda like a motion sensor i guess - checks for faces and captures images of faces if any are found. addon dependencies are ofxOpenCv(standard addon), ofxCv(https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv), and an edited version of ofxFaceTracker2(https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ofxFaceTracker2) that just makes all of the variables public to allow access to the number of instances
